# First Post

Welcome to Jotta.ai. Over the next few months I will be building and testing a new language learning platform, using myself as the guiena pig.

There are three main goals for this project:

1. To learn a new language
2. To explore new techniques for AI-assisted language learning
3. To experiment with the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) as a framework for building full stack applications

I'll do my best to keep this blog updated with my progress, learnings, and ideas.
